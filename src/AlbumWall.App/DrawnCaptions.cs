// AlbumWall — the buttons in a title bar the app draws itself, cut to what the desktop asked for.
//
// On native Wayland (since 2b3f43a) GNOME draws no title bars: a client that
// wants one draws its own, and for Preferences, the notices and the confirm
// box, Avalonia 12 does. Its title bar carries four buttons whatever the
// desktop says: full screen, minimize, maximize and close. It greys out the
// ones a window cannot use rather than leaving them off, so Preferences, which
// cannot be resized, showed two dead buttons (full screen and maximize) beside
// the two GNOME asked for. Spotted by him on 2026-09-22, and settled the same
// day: an owned window like Preferences gets Close and nothing else.
//
// The main window has no title bar of Avalonia's (decorations=None) and draws
// its own buttons from the same WindowButtons.Layout this uses, so both kinds
// of window now obey one rule.
